The Game I made in 4 week for school project

# 🎮 KlassenKletterer

> Climb as high as you can on quirky school-themed platforms! Pens, erasers—and your reflexes—will decide how far you go.

## 🎮 Game Overview

**KlassenKletterer** is a vertical climbing platformer built in Pygame. You control a student avatar ascending through an endless array of static and moving “school supply” platforms. Land on a platform and you automatically bounce upward—keep climbing before you fall off the bottom of the screen!

- **Theme**: School supplies (pens as static platforms, erasers as moving ones).
- **Personal Touch**: Enter your name at the start; your high score is saved locally per name.
- **Endless Challenge**: Procedurally generated platforms with increasing difficulty.
- **Retro Arcade Feel**: Simple pixel-style assets, smooth vertical scrolling, score & timer HUD.
